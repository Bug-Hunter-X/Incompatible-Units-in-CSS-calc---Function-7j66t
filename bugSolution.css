To fix this, ensure that units used within the `calc()` expression are compatible and consistently used. If necessary, convert units for proper mathematical operations. For example, if you need to add pixels and percentages, you might convert percentages to pixels based on the parent element's width.  Or, avoid mixing incompatible units all together by using only percentages or pixels in the expression.
